        <div class="questions">
            <h3 class="question">What visas am I eligible for as an Australian?</h3>
            <p>There are three visa categories that Australian’s are uniquely eligible to apply for: E1, E2, and E3… <a class="read-more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse1">read more</a></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapse1">
              <div>
                  <p>The United States has many visa categories that are open to people who want to work there, ranging from the most common H1B to the more elite O-1. I’m not going to cover these highly competitive and selective categories but you can read more on the US immigration service website here.</p>

                  <p>Australian’s have a class of their own in terms of visas: The E-Class. These include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>E1 - specialty trade visa. 99.9% of people are not eligible.</li>
                      <li>E2 - an investor visa, requires “substantial” investment circa $200,000+ depending on type of business.</li>
                      <li>E3 - for specialty occupations</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    E3 is the most common and which I’ll spend the most time on here. The visa is open to anyone with a tertiary degree (or equivalent work experience) There is a quota of 10,000 E3 visas released each year and this quota has yet to be hit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Benefits of the E3:
                      <ul>
                        <li>- Spouses of the E3 visa holder are eligible for the E3D visa which also allow them to work in the US </li>
                        <li>- Minor dependents of the visa holder can attend educational institutions</li>
                        <li>- You can transfer to a different employer without needing to apply for a new visa.</li>
                      </ul>

            <h3 class="question">Do I need to get a lawyer to do an E3 or can I do it myself? </h3>
            <p>The short answer is "it depends".

              <div>
                            <p>Personally when I was applying for my first E3 for the company I started I wanted to use a lawyer for a few of reasons...

                  <ol>
                    <li>I’m historically bad at admin work and the more I can outsource in life the better.</li>
                    <li>It was incredibly important for me to get the visa to be able to move to the US and I didn’t want to risk anything going wrong
                    </li>
                    <li>I didn’t have an Australian tertiary degree and would need to prove an equivalence
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We had a little money in the bank after raising capital and it felt like money well spent.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

            <h3 class="question">What do I need to do if I want to do my own visa application?</h3>

            <p>The basic process for getting an E3 is relatively simple.
            <a class="read-more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse2">read more</a></p>
                        <div class="collapse" id="collapse2">

            <p>You fill in form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker with four accompanying pieces of documentation:
            <ul>
              <li>- A Labor Condition Application from your employer</li>
            <li>- Evidence of your academic or other credentials</li>
            <li>- A job offer letter or documentation from employer</li>
            <li>- Any licensing specific to your job (like a medical registration)</li>

            <p>You submit to an interview at a US embassy outside of the country and that’s about it. Once approved you will be able to stay in the US for 2 years, with unlimited renewals.</p>

            <p>The definitive guide to getting an E3 visa has been put together by expat Australian Geoff McQueen, founder of <a href="https://accelo.com">Accelo</a> and board member at the Australian Founder Network.  It includes instructions on how to answer each of the forms you need, what to do on interview day and stories on what really happens behind the scene. You can check it out <a href="https://geoffmcqueen.com/2011/09/28/e-3-visa-for-australians-how-to/">here</a>.

            <h3 class="question">Am I eligible for an E3 visa if I don’t have a tertiary degree?</h3>

            <p>You don’t necessarily need a university or college degree to be eligible for an E3, but you will need to prove equivalent work experience.<a class="read-more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse2">read more</a></p>
                        <div class="collapse" id="collapse2">

            <p>"Equivalent work experience” is an intentionally vague term but is roughly calculated as 12 years of relevant professional experience, where every three years of work is equivalent to a year of a standard 4 year US bachelors degree.</p>
            <p>
            While you can apply yourself to prove that your 12 years of professional experience is a “degree equivalency” it’s a risky and time intensive process to take. You would need to get letters of reference on official letterheads, official HR documents explaining your tenure, detailed position descriptions, tax returns or some similar financial document, examples of awards or membership to professional organizations etc.</p>

            <p>The recommended method is to instead work with a US company to get your professional experience accredited as equivalent to a bachelors degree. This should help you pass this test easier and they’ll be able to guide you through the process.</p>
